# Dude-Simulator-6-Mod
Unlimited Ammo, Unlocked all weapons, Extremely buffed health, Speed Buff, Jump Buff, Buffed money drop, Free Money

I also tried fixing their save system since it doesn't work but I don't really understand how unity works so I can't figure out how their save system works

# Instructions

Find your Dude Simulator 6 installation folder/path then open `DudeSimualtorSix_Data` and then open `Managed` and drag/drop the modded DLL to replace the vanilla one.
